It creates an IAM Credentials secret, a service ID and service policy that will allow the job running in code engine to access secrets manager to update the custom secret. The architecture also creates an IAM service authorization between secrets manager and code engine project. In order to use this deployable architecture make sure a secrets manager instance is created with IAM credentials engine configured or use [Cloud automation for Secrets Manager](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-secrets-manager) and a code engine job is present with the required image. \n\nLeverage [Terraform IBM Modules](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules) to shape and scale your solutions. You can integrate Terraform IBM Modules (TIM) to extend functionality and design a solution tailored to your environment and operations needs. These modules offer reusable, customizable elements that follow IBM Cloud's recommended practices. You can access the [source code and documentation](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/terraform-ibm-secrets-manager-custom-credentials-engine) and use it to extend your current architecture or create new solutions.\n\nℹ️ This Terraform-based automation is part of a broader suite of IBM-maintained Infrastructure as Code (IaC) assets, each following the naming pattern \"Cloud automation for *servicename*\" and focusing on single IBM Cloud service. These single-service deployable architectures can be used on their own to streamline and automate service deployments through an [IaC approach](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understanding-projects), or assembled together into a broader [automated IaC stack](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-stack) to automate the deployment of an end-to-end solution architecture.",
